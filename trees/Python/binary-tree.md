A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node of the tree is called the root. 

In a binary tree:

1. Each node can have at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.
2. The structure is recursive, meaning each child subtree is also a binary tree.
3. Nodes can contain a piece of data, which is often referred to as the "key."
4. The order of insertion and arrangement of nodes determine the shape of the tree.
5. Binary trees are widely used in computer science for efficient searching, sorting, and retrieval operations.

Binary trees can come in various forms such as binary search trees (BSTs), balanced binary trees like AVL trees or red-black trees, binary heaps, and more. They offer efficient algorithms for various operations like insertion, deletion, search, and traversal.


Sure, here's a basic implementation of a binary tree in Python:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, key):
        self.key = key
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class BinaryTree:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None

    def insert(self, key):
        if not self.root:
            self.root = TreeNode(key)
        else:
            self._insert_recursive(self.root, key)

    def _insert_recursive(self, node, key):
        if key < node.key:
            if node.left:
                self._insert_recursive(node.left, key)
            else:
                node.left = TreeNode(key)
        elif key > node.key:
            if node.right:
                self._insert_recursive(node.right, key)
            else:
                node.right = TreeNode(key)

    def search(self, key):
        return self._search_recursive(self.root, key)

    def _search_recursive(self, node, key):
        if not node:
            return False
        if node.key == key:
            return True
        elif key < node.key:
            return self._search_recursive(node.left, key)
        else:
            return self._search_recursive(node.right, key)
```

This code defines a `TreeNode` class representing each node in the binary tree and a `BinaryTree` class representing the binary tree itself. The `insert` method is used to insert a new key into the tree, and the `search` method is used to search for a key in the tree.

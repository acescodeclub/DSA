Recursion is a programming concept where a function calls itself directly or indirectly in order to solve a problem. It is a powerful and elegant technique, particularly useful for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. In Python, recursion is supported, and many algorithms can be expressed more concisely using recursive functions.

Let's explore some common examples of recursion in Python:

1. **Factorial Calculation:**
   The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. The recursive definition of factorial is quite straightforward:

   ```python
   def factorial(n):
       if n == 0 or n == 1:
           return 1
       else:
           return n * factorial(n-1)
   ```



2. **Fibonacci Sequence:**
   The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. A recursive implementation for calculating the nth Fibonacci number is as follows:

   ```python
   def fibonacci(n):
       if n <= 1:
           return n
       else:
           return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)
   ```


3. **Binary Search:**
   Recursive implementations are common in searching algorithms as well. Here's an example of a recursive binary search in Python:

   ```python
   def binary_search(arr, target, low, high):
       if low <= high:
           mid = (low + high) // 2
           if arr[mid] == target:
               return mid
           elif arr[mid] < target:
               return binary_search(arr, target, mid + 1, high)
           else:
               return binary_search(arr, target, low, mid - 1)
       else:
           return -1
   ```


Recursion can be a powerful tool, but it's essential to handle base cases carefully to prevent infinite loops. Additionally, excessive recursion can lead to stack overflow errors, so it's important to consider the efficiency and potential alternative solutions for large problems.
